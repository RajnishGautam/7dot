    <h1>Professional Website Development in Lucknow & Chandigarh</h1>

    <p>In today’s digital-first world, your website is more than just an online presence — it is the <strong>face of your brand</strong>. Customers in India, especially in cities like Lucknow and Chandigarh, expect websites that are fast, responsive, and visually engaging. At 7Dot It, we deliver <strong>custom website development</strong> solutions that combine creativity, performance, and SEO optimization to help your business attract and convert customers effectively.</p>

    <h2>Why a Strong Website Matters</h2>
    <p>Your website is often the first point of contact for potential customers. In Lucknow, mobile usage dominates, and slow-loading sites can quickly drive visitors away. In Chandigarh, businesses thrive on modern design and smooth navigation that leads directly to conversions. A well-developed website ensures:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lightning-fast load times under 3 seconds</li>
      <li>Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layouts</li>
      <li>SEO-optimized architecture for higher search visibility</li>
      <li>Consistent branding across every page</li>
      <li>Better engagement and higher conversion rates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding the Indian Market</h2>
    <p>Unlike a one-size-fits-all approach, businesses in India need websites that reflect local culture, preferences, and search behavior. For example, businesses in Lucknow often cater to customers who prefer bilingual content (English and Hindi), while Chandigarh-based companies may target tech-savvy audiences familiar with IT services and startups. Our development strategies are rooted in these insights to deliver <strong>region-specific solutions</strong> that actually connect with your audience.</p>

    <h2>Our Website Development Process</h2>
    <p>We follow a proven step-by-step process to deliver high-performing websites tailored for Indian businesses, especially in Lucknow and Chandigarh.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Discovery & Research:</strong> We analyze your business, target audience, and competitors while focusing on local insights from <strong>Lucknow</strong> and <strong>Chandigarh</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>UI/UX Design:</strong> We design user-friendly and visually striking interfaces that engage and guide visitors seamlessly.</li>
      <li><strong>Development:</strong> Using modern technologies like HTML5, CSS3, React, Node.js, and CMS platforms, we build scalable and secure websites.</li>
      <li><strong>SEO Optimization:</strong> Location-based SEO is integrated from the start, targeting high-value keywords like <strong>“website development in Lucknow”</strong> and <strong>“affordable web design in Chandigarh”</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing & QA:</strong> Our websites go through strict testing for devices, browsers, and performance speed.</li>
      <li><strong>Launch & Support:</strong> We launch your site with continuous monitoring and long-term support.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Responsive Design for All Devices</h2>
    <p>With mobile-first usage growing across India, responsive design is at the core of every project. Our websites ensure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consistent branding across mobiles, tablets, and desktops</li>
      <li>Fast load times for better engagement</li>
      <li>Simplified navigation across devices</li>

  content: `
    <p>Digital marketing is evolving faster than ever before. Businesses in <strong>Mexico and the USA</strong> face unique challenges and opportunities when it comes to staying relevant, building trust, and driving conversions. What worked just a year ago may already feel outdated. Consumers are more connected, more informed, and more selective about the brands they engage with. For that reason, keeping up with the latest <strong>digital marketing trends</strong> is not just important—it’s essential for survival and growth.</p>

    <p>At 7Dot It, we work with companies across industries—ranging from e-commerce brands to B2B service providers—and we see firsthand which strategies actually drive measurable results. In this article, we will explore the biggest <strong>digital marketing trends</strong> shaping Mexico and the USA, complete with examples, statistics, and actionable tips you can use right away. Whether you’re a startup or a growing enterprise, these trends will help you future-proof your strategy and maximize ROI.</p>

    <h2>1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Marketing</h2>
    <p>AI is no longer just a buzzword. It is fundamentally reshaping digital marketing worldwide, and both Mexican and US businesses are adopting it at a rapid pace. From AI-powered analytics to automated ad optimization, brands are using machine learning to better understand their customers and make smarter decisions.</p>
    
    <h3>How AI is Changing Digital Marketing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> AI tools allow brands to deliver personalized recommendations based on browsing and purchase history.</li>
      <li><strong>Chatbots:</strong> Businesses are using conversational AI on websites and WhatsApp to provide 24/7 support.</li>
      <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> AI helps predict which customers are most likely to convert, saving ad spend and increasing efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>A retail company in Mexico used AI to personalize its e-commerce homepage. By showing different products to different audience segments, they increased conversion rates by 32% in just two months.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Tip</h3>
    <p>If you’re starting small, begin with <strong>AI-powered ad platforms like Google Performance Max or Facebook Advantage+</strong>. These tools automatically test and optimize ads for the best results.</p>

    <h2>2. Short-Form Video Dominance</h2>
    <p>Platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts are dominating consumer attention in both Mexico and the USA. The younger audience, especially Gen Z, prefers snackable video content that entertains, educates, or inspires in under 60 seconds. But this isn’t just about entertainment—short-form video is now a serious driver of conversions.</p>

    <h3>Why Short-Form Video Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Consumers are 2.5x more likely to share short-form video than any other type of content.</li>
      <li>Videos increase retention rates—viewers remember 95% of a message from video compared to only 10% from text.</li>
      <li>Algorithms on TikTok and Instagram prioritize video, giving brands organic reach they rarely achieve elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study</h3>
    <p>A US clothing brand launched a TikTok campaign showcasing “behind-the-scenes” content of their manufacturing process. The videos went viral, achieving over 1M views, and increased online sales by 120% within three months.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Tip</h3>
    <p>Don’t overproduce. Authentic, relatable videos often outperform glossy, expensive campaigns. Focus on <strong>storytelling, trending audio, and quick tips</strong> to connect with your audience.</p>

    <h2>3. Voice Search Optimization</h2>
    <p>With the rise of smart speakers like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri, voice search is becoming a crucial part of SEO. In Mexico, mobile-driven searches are growing, while in the USA, smart home devices are mainstream. Both markets are seeing a rise in conversational search queries such as “best tacos near me” or “affordable marketing services USA.”</p>

    <h3>Strategies for Voice SEO</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use natural, conversational language in your content.</li>
      <li>Optimize for long-tail keywords (e.g., “best digital marketing agency in Mexico City”).</li>
      <li>Leverage structured data and FAQs to increase your chances of appearing in voice results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Actionable Tip</h3>
    <p>Start by analyzing your existing website content. Are you answering questions that your customers are likely to ask out loud? If not, create a dedicated FAQ page optimized for voice search.</p>

    <h2>4. Localized Marketing Strategies</h2>
    <p>Consumers in Mexico and the USA respond differently to marketing, making <strong>localization</strong> a necessity. What works in Los Angeles may not resonate in Guadalajara. Businesses that adapt messaging, imagery, and campaigns to fit local culture build stronger trust and loyalty.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Localization</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Mexico, Facebook remains one of the top platforms for brand discovery.</li>
      <li>In the USA, LinkedIn is crucial for B2B and professional services.</li>
      <li>Language adaptation (Spanish vs. English, or bilingual content) increases inclusivity and relevance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study</h3>
    <p>A Mexican restaurant chain ran Facebook campaigns in Spanish with locally relevant imagery and saw a 200% increase in engagement compared to their English-language ads.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Tip</h3>
    <p>Use geo-targeting in Google Ads and Facebook Ads to deliver campaigns tailored to specific cities or neighborhoods.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Privacy and Customer Trust</h2>
    <p>With growing concerns about data privacy, especially with GDPR and CCPA regulations, brands need to prioritize <strong>transparent data practices</strong>. Customers in both Mexico and the USA want to know how their data is used.</p>

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Be transparent about data collection and usage.</li>
      <li>Offer opt-ins and respect customer preferences.</li>
      <li>Focus on building first-party data through email lists and loyalty programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Actionable Tip</h3>
    <p>Encourage customers to subscribe to newsletters or sign up for loyalty rewards. This way, you own the relationship without relying too heavily on third-party data.</p>

    <h2>6. Influencer Partnerships</h2>
    <p>Influencer marketing is exploding in both Mexico and the USA, but with a shift towards micro and nano-influencers. These smaller creators often have more engaged audiences and offer better ROI compared to celebrity endorsements.</p>

    <h3>Why Micro-Influencers Work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>They have authentic relationships with their followers.</li>
      <li>They often charge lower fees, making them accessible to SMEs.</li>
      <li>Engagement rates are significantly higher compared to large influencers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study</h3>
    <p>A skincare brand in Mexico collaborated with 20 micro-influencers on Instagram. The campaign generated 3x more conversions than their previous celebrity influencer campaign.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Digital marketing in Mexico and the USA is rapidly shifting towards <strong>AI-driven personalization, short-form video dominance, localized campaigns, and trust-based strategies</strong>. Brands that adapt early to these trends will enjoy greater visibility, stronger engagement, and higher ROI. Whether you’re focusing on SEO, PPC, or influencer partnerships, the key is to stay agile, experiment, and keep your audience at the heart of your strategy.</p>

  title: "How Local Digital Marketing Helps You Win Customers in Mexico & USA",
  image: "/blog/marketing13.jpg",
  excerpt: "7Dot It creates hyper-local marketing strategies that help businesses in Mexico & USA capture nearby customers through SEO and ads.",
  content: `
    <p>When people search online for products or services, they often want results that are close to home. Whether it’s a café in Mexico City or a dental clinic in Los Angeles, <strong>local digital marketing</strong> ensures your business shows up in the right place, at the right time. In fact, research shows that <strong>46% of all Google searches are looking for local information</strong>. For businesses in <strong>Mexico and the USA</strong>, this represents a huge opportunity to attract nearby customers who are ready to buy.</p>

    <p>At 7Dot It, we help brands connect with their local audience through a mix of <strong>local SEO, Google Maps optimization, geo-targeted ads, and localized content strategies</strong>. In this detailed guide, we’ll explore why local digital marketing matters, the top strategies to implement, and real-world examples of businesses thriving with localized campaigns.</p>

    <h2>1. Why Local Digital Marketing is Essential</h2>
    <p>Local marketing ensures your business is visible to the people most likely to visit you or purchase your services. Without it, you risk being invisible in your own neighborhood while competitors capture the market. Let’s break down why it matters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customer Intent:</strong> Local searchers usually have strong buying intent. Someone searching “best tacos in Guadalajara” is far more likely to make a purchase than someone reading a general food blog.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile Usage:</strong> In Mexico and the USA, over 70% of local searches happen on mobile phones. This means customers are often searching while they’re out and ready to make quick decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Trust and Familiarity:</strong> Appearing in local search results builds trust. Customers feel reassured when they see a business listed on Google Maps with positive reviews.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Google Business Profile (Formerly Google My Business)</h2>
    <p>One of the most powerful tools for local visibility is a <strong>Google Business Profile</strong>. When optimized, your profile can help you appear in the coveted “Local Pack” (the map listings that appear at the top of local search results).</p>
    <h3>Optimization Checklist</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure your name, address, and phone number (NAP) are consistent across all platforms.</li>
      <li>Add high-quality photos of your storefront, products, and team.</li>
      <li>Collect and respond to customer reviews regularly.</li>
      <li>Use Google Posts to share promotions, events, or announcements.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Case Study</h3>
    <p>A dental clinic in Mexico City optimized its Google Business Profile and encouraged satisfied patients to leave reviews. Within three months, it saw a 65% increase in appointment bookings directly from Google Maps.</p>

    <h2>3. Local SEO for Websites</h2>
    <p>Beyond Google Maps, your website needs to be optimized for local searches. Local SEO focuses on ensuring your business shows up when users type location-based queries like “digital marketing agency near me” or “best restaurant in Monterrey.”</p>
    <h3>Strategies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location Pages:</strong> Create dedicated pages for each city or region you serve.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Keywords:</strong> Incorporate phrases like “plumber in Houston” or “marketing services in Guadalajara.”</li>
      <li><strong>Schema Markup:</strong> Add structured data to help Google better understand your business details.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile Speed:</strong> Ensure your site loads fast on mobile, as local users often search on the go.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Case Study</h3>
    <p>A Mexican bakery with multiple branches created location-specific landing pages. Each page ranked locally within 4 months, resulting in a 220% increase in in-store visits from Google search traffic.</p>

    <h2>4. Geo-Targeted Advertising</h2>
    <p>Paid advertising becomes much more effective when combined with geo-targeting. Instead of wasting money on irrelevant clicks, you can ensure ads only appear to users within your service area.</p>
    <h3>Platforms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Ads:</strong> Target users searching for services in your area with location extensions.</li>
      <li><strong>Facebook & Instagram Ads:</strong> Use advanced geo-targeting to reach people within a specific radius.</li>
      <li><strong>Waze Ads:</strong> Perfect for driving customers directly to physical locations like restaurants, gas stations, or retail stores.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>A fitness studio in Los Angeles used Facebook Ads targeting users within a 10-mile radius. They offered a free trial pass and generated 500+ new sign-ups in two months.</p>

    <h2>5. Reputation Management</h2>
    <p>In both Mexico and the USA, <strong>online reviews heavily influence local purchasing decisions</strong>. A business with 50 positive reviews will always have an edge over one with none.</p>
    <h3>Strategies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourage happy customers to leave reviews on Google and Yelp.</li>
      <li>Respond quickly to negative reviews with professionalism and empathy.</li>
      <li>Highlight positive testimonials on your website and social media.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Case Study</h3>
    <p>A Guadalajara spa made it a policy to ask every satisfied customer for a review. Within 6 months, it had 300+ five-star reviews, leading to a 70% increase in new client bookings.</p>

    <h2>6. Localized Content Marketing</h2>
    <p>Generic content won’t cut it if you want to dominate locally. Instead, create blogs, videos, and campaigns tailored to the culture and preferences of your target audience.</p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A restaurant in Monterrey created a blog about “Top 10 Traditional Dishes in Monterrey” and ranked for local food searches.</li>
      <li>A law firm in Texas published a video guide about “Legal Rights for Small Business Owners in Houston,” building authority and local trust.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Actionable Tip</h3>
    <p>Research trending local events, holidays, or festivals and create content that ties your business to them.</p>

    <h2>7. Mobile-First Strategy</h2>
    <p>Since most local searches happen on smartphones, your mobile experience needs to be seamless. If users can’t quickly find directions, contact info, or booking options, they’ll move on to a competitor.</p>
    <h3>Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fast-loading mobile pages (under 3 seconds).</li>
      <li>Clickable phone numbers and addresses.</li>
      <li>Easy-to-use mobile booking or contact forms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Hyperlocal Social Media Marketing</h2>
    <p>Social platforms allow brands to connect with customers in specific neighborhoods. Whether it’s promoting a local event or running location-based hashtags, hyperlocal strategies build stronger community engagement.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>A café in Mexico City used Instagram Stories to promote live music nights and tagged the neighborhood. The posts were shared widely, and weekend sales increased by 40%.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Local digital marketing in Mexico and the USA is no longer optional—it’s the backbone of visibility, trust, and growth for small and medium businesses. By optimizing your Google Business Profile, investing in local SEO, leveraging geo-targeted ads, and building strong customer reviews, you position your brand as the go-to option in your community.</p>

  excerpt: "Explore how businesses in Mexico & USA can leverage SEO, AI-driven tools, social media, and content marketing to stay ahead in 2025.",
  content: `
    <p>The world of digital marketing is evolving at lightning speed. Businesses in <strong>Mexico and the USA</strong> are navigating a landscape where consumer expectations are shifting, algorithms are constantly updated, and new technologies like AI and automation are becoming integral. To remain competitive, brands must understand and adopt the <strong>latest marketing trends</strong> shaping 2025.</p>

    <p>At 7Dot It, we specialize in helping companies adapt their strategies for both Mexican and U.S. markets. These countries share some similarities but also have unique cultural, economic, and digital ecosystems. This blog dives deep into the <strong>emerging trends</strong> that are transforming how businesses attract, engage, and retain customers.</p>

    <h2>1. AI-Powered Marketing</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence has moved beyond being a buzzword — it is now the backbone of modern marketing. In both Mexico and the USA, businesses are embracing AI-driven tools to personalize experiences, analyze consumer behavior, and automate repetitive tasks.</p>

    <h3>AI in Mexico</h3>
    <p>Mexican businesses are increasingly adopting AI chatbots for WhatsApp, one of the country’s most widely used platforms. These bots streamline customer support, handle FAQs, and even assist with sales transactions. For small and medium businesses (SMBs), AI provides cost-effective solutions that were once only available to large corporations.</p>

    <h3>AI in the USA</h3>
    <p>In the U.S., AI is playing a huge role in advanced personalization. For example, e-commerce companies leverage AI to recommend products based on past behavior, while B2B firms use predictive analytics to qualify leads. Tools like HubSpot and Salesforce Einstein are becoming must-haves for marketing automation.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Tip:</strong> Brands in both markets should invest in AI-powered analytics to understand audience preferences and create highly targeted campaigns.</p>

    <h2>2. Video Marketing and Short-Form Content</h2>
    <p>Video remains king, but the format has changed. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts dominate consumer attention, especially among younger audiences in Mexico and Gen Z in the USA.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Mexican fashion brands are driving sales with TikTok campaigns that use local music and influencers.</li>
      <li>U.S. B2B companies are using LinkedIn native video to share thought leadership and humanize their brand.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pro Insight:</strong> Brands should not only create polished videos but also experiment with authentic, raw, behind-the-scenes content. This resonates more with audiences who crave transparency.</p>

    <h2>3. Voice Search and Conversational Marketing</h2>
    <p>With the rise of smart speakers like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, voice search optimization is critical. In Mexico, consumers are using Spanish-language queries, while U.S. buyers mix English and Spanglish depending on their cultural background.</p>

    <p><strong>Action Point:</strong> Optimize your website for long-tail, natural language queries such as “best taco restaurants near me” or “affordable SEO agency in Los Angeles.” Conversational marketing tools like chatbots can also capture leads directly from voice-enabled platforms.</p>

    <h2>4. Social Commerce</h2>
    <p>Social commerce — selling directly through platforms like Instagram Shops, Facebook Marketplace, and TikTok Shop — is growing rapidly.</p>

    <h3>Mexico</h3>
    <p>In Mexico, where social media adoption is high, small businesses are leveraging Instagram Shops to sell handmade crafts and apparel. Trust and authenticity play a major role in buying decisions, so influencer partnerships are essential.</p>

    <h3>USA</h3>
    <p>In the USA, consumers expect a seamless shopping experience. TikTok Shop and Facebook Marketplace are thriving, and big brands integrate Shopify with social platforms for smooth transactions.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A U.S.-based beauty brand increased sales by 200% after enabling direct Instagram shopping with influencer promotions.</p>

    <h2>5. Localized and Multilingual SEO</h2>
    <p>SEO strategies in Mexico and the USA must adapt to cultural and linguistic differences. Mexican audiences respond better to content in Spanish with a local touch, while U.S. markets require both English and Spanish content to capture Hispanic buyers.</p>

    <p><strong>Pro Strategy:</strong> Use tools like Google Keyword Planner to identify Spanish-language keywords popular in Mexico (e.g., “agencia de marketing digital México”) and optimize U.S. campaigns for bilingual search queries (e.g., “best SEO services USA” / “mejor agencia SEO USA”).</p>

    <h2>6. Data Privacy and Transparency</h2>
    <p>Consumers are more concerned about how their data is used. With laws like GDPR, CCPA, and Mexico’s Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data, businesses must prioritize transparency.</p>

    <p>Providing clear opt-in options, easy-to-read privacy policies, and secure payment methods are no longer optional — they are competitive differentiators.</p>

    <h2>7. Influencer and Micro-Influencer Marketing</h2>
    <p>Influencer marketing is maturing. In Mexico, nano-influencers (with 1,000–10,000 followers) often have more engaged audiences compared to celebrity influencers. In the USA, micro-influencers are considered more authentic and cost-effective.</p>

    <p><strong>Case Study:</strong> A Mexican coffee brand collaborated with 20 nano-influencers in Mexico City, achieving a 400% increase in brand mentions. Meanwhile, a U.S. SaaS company leveraged LinkedIn influencers to generate quality B2B leads.</p>

    <h2>8. Content Marketing with a Purpose</h2>
    <p>Consumers are seeking more than just products — they want to connect with brands that align with their values. Storytelling, sustainability, and social responsibility campaigns are trending in both Mexico and the U.S.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Brands are sharing stories about supporting local communities.</li>
      <li>Eco-friendly initiatives are highlighted in marketing campaigns.</li>
      <li>Diversity and inclusivity messaging is non-negotiable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Omnichannel Experiences</h2>
    <p>Customers expect seamless interactions across platforms — from websites to apps to in-store experiences. For example, a shopper might discover a product on Instagram, research it on Google, and complete the purchase in a physical store. Your marketing must integrate all these touchpoints.</p>

    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use CRM tools to unify customer data and deliver consistent messaging across email, social, and paid channels.</p>

    <h2>10. The Rise of Automation</h2>
    <p>Email drip campaigns, SMS marketing, and automated ad retargeting are essential in 2025. Automation helps brands nurture leads and save time without compromising personalization.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The digital marketing landscape in Mexico and the USA is both challenging and full of opportunity. By embracing AI, short-form video, localized SEO, and social commerce, businesses can stay ahead of the curve in 2025. The key is to remain adaptable, data-driven, and customer-focused.</p>

    <p>At 7Dot It, we help businesses implement strategies tailored to their target markets in both countries. Whether you’re looking to optimize SEO, create impactful social media campaigns, or launch high-ROI PPC ads, we are here to guide you.</p>

At 7Dot It, we specialize in creating <strong>social media marketing strategies</strong> that engage, inspire, and convert.</p>

    <h2>The Power of Social Media Marketing</h2>
    <p>Over 4.9 billion people use social media globally, and in Mexico alone, nearly 95 million are active users. In the USA, the number surpasses 300 million. This makes social media one of the most effective channels for reaching customers where they spend the majority of their time. But success on these platforms isn’t about random posting—it’s about creating <strong>consistent, targeted, and data-driven campaigns</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Why Businesses in Mexico & USA Need Social Media Marketing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In Mexico</strong>, Facebook dominates with 98% usage, making it perfect for ads and community groups.</li>
      <li><strong>In the USA</strong>, Instagram and TikTok are critical for younger audiences, while LinkedIn is the go-to for B2B engagement.</li>

      <li><strong>Stories & Polls</strong> for real-time engagement</li>
      <li><strong>LinkedIn articles</strong> for professional networking</li>

    <h3>4. Community Management</h3>

    <h3>5. Analytics & Optimization</h3>

    <h2>Platform-Specific Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Facebook & Instagram</h3>
